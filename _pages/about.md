Hi! I'm a senior quantitative analyst at Leidos working on public health preparedness with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I recently graduated with my PhD from the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University as part of the [Troyanskaya Lab](https://function.princeton.edu/). Before coming to Princeton, I finished my undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for five years as a software engineer and data analyst in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. 

I'm a data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning, data engineering, database management, data modeling, version control, API development, data visualization, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, and statistical analysis. My previous work has been published in high impact scientific journals, including *Cell*, *Cell Systems*, and *Nature*, and I am adept at collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to achieve large-scale objectives. To see some examples of my previous work, please visit my [Projects page](https://williamthistle.github.io/projects/) or download my [resume](https://williamthistle.github.io/files/Thistlethwaite_William_Resume.pdf). For a complete list of my publications and preprints, you can visit my [Publications page](https://williamthistle.github.io/publications/) or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7cG7u7UAAAAJ&hl=en).
