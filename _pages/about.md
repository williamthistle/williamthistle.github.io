Hi! I'm a sixth year PhD candidate in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University. 

Before coming to Princeton and joining the [Troyanskaya lab](https://function.princeton.edu/), I finished my undergraduate degrees in English and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Heels!), attended law school for two years at Columbia Law School, got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for five years as a software engineer and data analyst in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. In other words, it's been an interesting journey!

I'm a data scientist with 10 years of experience in machine learning, data engineering, database management, data modeling, version control, deep learning, API development, data visualization, and statistical analysis. My previous work has been published in high impact scientific journals, including Cell, Cell Systems, and Nature, and I have a proven track record of partnering with scientific labs and engineering teams to achieve large-scale objectives.

I'm excited to share that I will be defending my thesis in December of 2024! I am on the job market, looking for remote opportunities in industry where I can apply my skills in machine learning and data science to make long-lasting impact. To see examples of my previous work, please visit my [Projects page](https://williamthistle.github.io/projects/) or download my [resume](https://williamthistle.github.io/files/Thistlethwaite_William_Resume_09-24-24.pdf). For a complete list of my publications, you can visit my [Publications page](https://williamthistle.github.io/publications/) or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7cG7u7UAAAAJ&hl=en).

A brief summary of my technical skills can be found below:

**Languages**: Python, R, Ruby, Bash, SQL  
**Frameworks**: PyTorch, XGBoost, Keras, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, tidyverse  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, NoSQL (MongoDB)  
**Platforms**: Git, SVN, MLflow, Docker
