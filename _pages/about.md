I'm a first year PhD student in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University. Before coming to Princeton, I finished my undergraduate degree in English and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, attended law school for two years at Columbia Law School (before dropping out), got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for 5 years in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. In other words, it's been an interesting journey!

My recent work has focused on developing online resources to better understand extracellular RNAs (e.g., [the exRNA Atlas](https://exrna-atlas.org/)), but I'm excited to move into more statistical work as a graduate student. Right now, I'm rotating in [Dr. John Storey's lab](http://storeylab.org/).
