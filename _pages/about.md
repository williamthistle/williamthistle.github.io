Hi! I'm a sixth year PhD candidate in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University. Before coming to Princeton and joining the [Troyanskaya Lab](https://function.princeton.edu/), I finished my undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for five years as a software engineer and data analyst in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. 

I'm a data scientist with **10 years of experience** in machine learning, data engineering, database management, data modeling, version control, API development, data visualization, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, and statistical analysis. My previous work has been published in high impact scientific journals, including *Cell*, *Cell Systems*, and *Nature*, and I am adept at collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to achieve large-scale objectives.

**I'm excited to share that I will be defending my thesis in December of 2024!** I am on the job market, looking for remote opportunities in industry where I can apply my skills in machine learning and data science to make long-lasting impact. To see examples of my previous work, please visit my [Projects page](https://williamthistle.github.io/projects/) or download my [resume](https://williamthistle.github.io/files/Thistlethwaite_William_Resume.pdf). For a complete list of my publications and preprints, you can visit my [Publications page](https://williamthistle.github.io/publications/) or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7cG7u7UAAAAJ&hl=en).

A brief overview of my technical skills can be found below:

**Programming Languages**: Python, R, Ruby, Bash, SQL, JavaScript  
**Machine Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, XGBoost, Keras, scikit-learn  
**Data Analysis & Visualization**: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, tidyverse  
**Cloud & DevOps Platforms**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), MLflow, Docker  
**Databases**: PostgreSQL, NoSQL, MongoDB  
**Version Control**: Git, GitHub, SVN
