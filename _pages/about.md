I'm a first year PhD student in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University. Before coming to Princeton, I finished my undergraduate degree in English and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, attended law school for two years at Columbia Law School (before dropping out), got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for five years as a programmer and analyst in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. In other words, it's been an interesting journey!

Before attending graduate school, my research focused on developing online resources to better understand extracellular RNAs (e.g., [the exRNA Atlas](https://exrna-atlas.org/)). Nowadays, I'm delving into statistical genomics, particularly in the context of disease prediction. I recently joined [Dr. Josh Akey's lab](https://akeylab.princeton.edu/) and I'm excited to figure out my thesis topic in the coming months.

Feel free to send an email or tweet if you have any questions or comments!
