I'm a fourth year PhD candidate in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University. 

Before coming to Princeton, I finished my undergraduate degrees in English and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Heels!), attended law school for two years at Columbia Law School, got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for five years as a programmer and analyst in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. In other words, it's been an interesting journey!

My past research focused on developing online resources to better understand extracellular RNAs (e.g., [the exRNA Atlas](https://exrna-atlas.org/)). Nowadays, I'm using machine learning to make predictions in the context of human health and disease as a member of [Dr. Olga Troyanskaya's lab](https://function.princeton.edu/). More to come soon!
