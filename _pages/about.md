I'm a sixth year PhD candidate in the [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://lsi.princeton.edu/qcbgraduate) program at Princeton University. 

Before coming to Princeton, I finished my undergraduate degrees in English and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Heels!), attended law school for two years at Columbia Law School, got my master's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, and worked for five years as a software engineer and data analyst in the [Bioinformatics Research Laboratory](http://genboree.org/site/bioinformatics_research_laboratory) at Baylor College of Medicine. In other words, it's been an interesting journey!

My past research focused on developing computational resources to better understand extracellular RNAs (e.g., [the exRNA Atlas](https://exrna-atlas.org/)). Nowadays, as a member of [Dr. Olga Troyanskaya's lab](https://function.princeton.edu/), I'm building software for end-to-end processing and analysis of single cell data ([SPEEDI](https://github.com/FunctionLab/SPEEDI)) and using machine learning approaches to better understand the long lasting effects of influenza infection.
